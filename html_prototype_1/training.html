			<b>Objective:</b>
			</br>
			You are the Bayview Medical Clinic manager who must schedule patients 
			</br>
			and hospital staff to treat as many patients as possible.
			</br><hr></br>
			
			<b>How to Play:</b>
			</br>
			There are 2 types of patients:
			</br>
			A: Standard
			</br>
			B: Surgery
			</br></br>
			The standard patient requires a doctor and a nurse in order to start recovery
			</br>
			and the surgery patients require a surgeon and a nurse to begin recovering.
			</br></br>
			As soon as a patient is assigned to a room and has both resources also 
			</br>
			assigned, a timer will begin to count down to their recovery.
			</br></br>
			You also have help! The neighboring medical clinic OneLife Medical Center
			</br>
			is willing to share staff with you. Both you and the Center can share
			</br>
			send and receive resources to help save the greatest numnber of patients.
			</br></br>

			</br><hr></br>
			<b>Interface:</b>
			</br>
			There are four main parts to the interface: Your panel, OneLife 
			</br>
			Medical's panel, rooms, and controls.
			</br></br>
			<img src="./pics/interface.png" style="width:600px;height:450px;">
			</br></br>
			To treat patients you need to assign them to a room with the correct hospital
			</br>
			staff. You have 6 rooms. Once a patient or staff is assigned to a room they
			</br>
			cannot be unassigned.
			</br></br>
			<img src="./pics/assigning.png" style="width:600px;height:450px;">
			</br></br>
			Within the waiting room, each circle represents a patient. The color of
			</br>
			the circles reflects the number of patients waiting:
			</br>
			Green: 1-2
			</br>
			Yellow: 2-4
			</br>
			Red: 5-6
			</br></br>
			The maximum capacity is 6. Once the waiting room is full, no new patients
			</br>
			can enter the waiting room.
			</br></br>
			Your available staff will be displayed in the Bayview Medical panel.
			</br>
			You can see OneLife's available staff and queu color as well. For each
			</br>
			patient treated in <b>EITHER</b> hospital increases the score by 1.
			</br></br>
			<img src="./pics/stats.png" style="width:200px;height:450px;">
			</br></br>
			After completing patient and staff assignment, treatment will begin.
			</br>
			When it completes after 60 seconds, you can collect your resources
			</br>
			by clicking the room before you can use them again.
			</br></br>
			<img src="./pics/collect.png" style="width:350px;height:450px;">
			</br><hr></br>
			<b>Trail run:</b>
			</br>
			You will play two runs. The first will begin when you go to the next
			</br>
			page by clicking the button at the bottom of the screen. This first
			</br>
			run will be for practice and allow you to get used to the controls.
			</br>
			This will last 2 minutes and then you will begin the full trial.
			</br>
			The full trial will be 8 minutes and a final score will be shown
			</br>
			at the end. Please contact the proctor if you have any further questions.
